## Install + Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Auth Env (Stage 0 Prep)
Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and set:
- `SESSION_SECRET`
- `ADMIN_EMAIL`
- `ADMIN_TEMP_PASSWORD`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

## Authentication
- The first admin account is created on startup using `ADMIN_EMAIL` + `ADMIN_TEMP_PASSWORD`.
- `ADMIN_TEMP_PASSWORD` is used only for initial seeding. Changing it later does not update an existing admin password.
- After first login with the temp password, the admin must set a new password.
- Passwords are stored as bcrypt hashes (not in plain text).
- Roles: `admin`, `manager`, `engineer`, `operator`, `viewer`.
- Access: admins see all experiments; others see only experiments they own.

## Core Flows
1) Create an experiment with recipes and machine assignment.
2) Run the 6‑step Scientific Molding qualification (each step has its own setup + runs).
3) Create multiple Detailed Optimization (DOE) studies under the same experiment.
4) Configure factors, generate runlists, and enter run data.
5) Review analysis (charts + heatmap + 3D when possible).
6) Generate and edit reports (multiple reports per experiment).
7) Track Tasks on a kanban board inside each experiment.

Planned: export data to CSV.

## Task Manager
- Tasks live inside each experiment and are shown as a 4-column kanban (Init / In progress / Done / Failed).
- Create a task with title, description, due date, and owner (defaults to the experiment owner).
- Link tasks to entities:
  - Qualification steps (1–6)
  - DOE studies
  - Reports (signature required)
- Task progress is calculated from linked entities; tasks without entities are driven by manual status moves.
- Reports can be signed inside the task popup (manager/engineer/admin).
- Each task has calendar actions: download .ics or open a Google Calendar link.

## Qualification (Scientific Molding)
The qualification flow includes 6 steps based on scientific molding methodology:
1) Rheology / Viscosity curve  
2) Cavity balance  
3) Pressure drop  
4) Cosmetic process window  
5) Gate seal study  
6) Cooling time optimization

## Report Plan (Next Work)
The current report plan lives at `report_plan` in the project root.

## Recent Changes (for handoff)
- Machine library now supports parameter tokens in the format `%machineId:paramId%`.
  These tokens can be used inside qualification setup inputs and custom fields.
- UI shows live previews for tokenized values; inputs keep the token, summaries display the resolved value.
- Step calculations resolve tokens at runtime (server + client), so values survive reloads.
- Machine edit page shows a small read-only token field next to each parameter for quick copy.
- Report generator now saves report configs per experiment (multiple reports per experiment).
- Report list lives inside the experiment, right after Detailed Optimization.
- Report editor (Editor.js) with seeded structure and embedded charts (rheology + process window).
- Editable report documents are stored in `report_documents` and opened via `/reports/:id/editor`.

## Supported Recipe Import Formats
The importer accepts two common formats:

### 1) Matrix format
```
Component,Recipe A,Recipe B
Resin 1,50,60
Resin 2,50,40
Additive,3,2
```
- Column 0: component name
- Other columns: recipe name with PHR values

### 2) Two-row header (BPACKs style)
```
,Recipe A,,Recipe B,
,phr,,phr,
Resin 1,50,,60,
Resin 2,50,,40,
Additive,3,,2,
```
- Row 1 contains recipe names
- Row 2 contains `phr` under recipe columns
- Subsequent rows are components

## Notes
- The SQLite database is `im_doe.sqlite` in this folder.
- Custom input/output fields are stored in the flexible `param_definitions` and `run_values` tables.
- SCREEN design is a sampled factorial (labeled in-app). For higher rigor, add a dedicated generator.

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` - start with hot reload
- `npm run build` - compile to `dist/`
- `npm run start` - run compiled output
